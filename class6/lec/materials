pynet-jnpr-srx1 (Juniper SRX) ssh_port=9822, netconf_port=830

The Arista-Ansible modules and the cisco_file_transfer.py module are located in ~/ANSIBLE/library. 
Ansible will need to know how to find these modules when you execute your playbook. 
By default, Ansible will look for a ./library subdirectory relative to your playbook's location. 
Consequenlty, you can place your playbooks in ~/ANSIBLE and Ansible will be able to find the libraries. 
Alternatively, you can specify where the libraries are located by using the '--module-path' argument:

 ansible-playbook <playbook_name> --module-path ~/ANSIBLE/library/

mportant notes about the lab environment

1. You will need to do this week's exercises on the AWS lab server. 

2. You have been assigned an Arista vEOS switch and an interface on this switch to work on. These items are specified in the 'ansible-hosts' file in your home directory.

For example, your ~/ansible-hosts file will contain something similar to the following:
[arista]
# primary interface == EthernetX
# secondary interface == EthernetY
pynet-swx ansible_connection=local eapi_username=eapi eapi_password=<passwd> 
    eapi_hostname=50.76.53.27 eapi_port=XXXX

EthernetX will be your primary switch interface
EthernetY will be your backup switch interface  
XXXX will be the eapi_port to use (for example, 8243)

Use the backup switch interface, if the primary switch interface is already in use.

Remember each Arista vEOS switch is shared with a set of students so be considerate of the other students while working on it. 

3. You should create your playbooks in the ~/ANSIBLE directory. This is so Ansible knows how to find the relevant modules (these modules are located in ~/ANSIBLE/library).


4. Please do NOT change any of the following on the Arista switches:

    a. The VLAN1 IP address
    b. The default gateway
    c. The Ethernet1 interface

Also please do NOT shutdown any of the Arista Ethernet interfaces. 
For some reason disabling any of the Ethernet interfaces causes the vEOS switch to completely lose connectivity. 



Exercises

If you haven't already read them, please see the important lab notes above.

My solutions to these exercises are posted at:
https://github.com/ktbyers/pynet/tree/master/pyth_ans_ecourse/class6


1. Using Ansible, configure three VLANs on the Arista switch specifying both the VLAN IDs and the VLAN names.  
For the VLAN IDs randomly pick three numbers between 100 and 999.


2. Use Ansible to configure your 'primary Ethernet interface' as follows:

interface description:     *** IN USE ***
switchport mode:          access
VLAN:                           <one of the VLANs created in exercise1>

Your 'primary Ethernet interface' is specified in your ~/ansible-hosts file.

If your primary interface is already 'IN USE' (by someone else), then use your secondary interface (once again specified in ~/ansible-hosts).  
You can determine if an interface is already in use by SSH'ing into the switch. Reminder, do NOT use Ethernet1.


3. Use Ansible to configure your 'primary Ethernet interface' as follows:

switchport mode:           trunk
trunk native VLAN:        VLAN1
trunk allowed VLANs:    <the three VLANs created in exercise1>


4. Use Ansible to restore your 'primary Ethernet interface' back to the following state (or your secondary interface depending on which one you used):

description:                    <none>
switchport mode:           access
access VLAN:                1
trunk allowed VLANs:    all

Also use Ansible to remove the three VLANs that you configured.


5. Use the cisco_file_transfer.py module to transfer a small file to the Cisco pynet-rtr1 router.
